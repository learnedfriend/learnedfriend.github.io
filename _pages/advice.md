### Fees

* I generally charge hourly fees. My standard hourly fee is **$250 + GST** (i.e. $287.50). I acknowledge that this expensive in absolute terms - but it is also at the lower end of fees charged by New Zealand lawyers.
* I offer a no-charge initial phone consultation of up to 30 minutes. After that, I can provide you with an estimate of the likely cost to carry out your instructions.
* Depending on your instructions, I may be able to offer a fixed fee.
* I generally do not offer conditional fee arrangements (such as 'no win, no fee'). If I think you have a strong case and we can objectively define a 'successful' outcome, then a conditional fee may be possible.

### Pro-bono work

* I have committed to doing at least five hours of pro-bono (free of charge) work each week. I reserve this time for clients who would otherwise not be in a financial position to instruct a lawyer. To apply, click here.
* If I decline to act for you pro-bono, I may be able to reduce my fee - but again, I reserve this arrangement for clients who would otherwise go without legal assistance.
* Accepting pro-bono work is at my sole discretion. I do not guarantee that I will accept pro-bono or reduced fee work, but I do guarantee that I will let you know as soon as possible whether I am able to assist.

### Legal aid
* I am a **supervised** legal aid provider in the following areas: civil, family, refugee/protected persons, parole, and criminal.
* This means that you can engage me to do legal aid work, but that a more senior lawyer will supervise my work. There is no extra cost to you for that supervision, but it does mean that my supervising lawyer will be involved in some aspects of your legal work.

### Standard terms of engagement
The following terms apply to our relationship with you if we agree to act for you. However, these terms are subject to any other agreement we might make - if we agree to work together on a different basis, then that agreement will take precedence over these terms.

1. We will comply with our professional duties as lawyers, including our obligations under the [Rules of conduct and client care for lawyers](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2008/0214/latest/DLM1437811.html)
2. You may terminate our relationship at any time, but remain liable for any fees incurred to that point and any disbursements we have paid for you. We may terminate our relationship in accordance with the Rules of conduct and client care for lawyers.
3. Any advice given by us is for your benefit only. You may share that advice freely, but we will only have obligations and liability to **you** in respect of that advice.
4. Once we have completed our instructions, we will cease to act as your lawyer. Some of our professional obligations will continue (such as a lawyer's duties of confidentiality), but we will no longer be responsible for providing legal advice or representation.
5. There are no 'hidden' or additional fees. **However**, you will be required to pay disbursements (i.e. external costs for things related to your instructions) like filing fees or courier costs.
6. For hourly fee work, we will ordinarily invoice you on a fortnightly basis - with payment due within seven days of our invoice. For other fee arrangements, we will agree payment terms with you before beginning work.
7. If you fail to pay fees due to us by the time they are due, we may refuse to perform further legal work for you and may terminate our relationship. We may also charge interest of up to 10% p.a. on the overdue amount.
8. We do not operate a trust account, which means we cannot hold money or other valuable property on your behalf.
10. We maintain professional indemnity insurance to the level required by the New Zealand Law Society. The total, aggregate liability of us and our insurers (cumulatively) to you will not exceed that amount.
