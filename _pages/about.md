<b>Kia ora!</b> I'm a New Zealand lawyer interested in solving tricky problems. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.

I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a 'lead provider'.

I love the law, and I want to share it with everyone. I've created more than 50 self-help legal resources, which you can find here. I also write regularly about the law here.

To kick things off:
- if your problem is urgent, call me on <a href="tel:+64 27 357 1665">+64 27 357 1665</a>. If I do not pick up, text or email me and I will respond as soon as possible.
- for a no-charge initial consultation, please book directly into my calendar
- for pro-bono or reduced fee assistance, please [fill out this form](form) instead of booking a time or emailing. I will respond to your enquiry within one week.
- otherwise, please email me: tyrone@spilledmilk.nz

*If you are looking for a lawyer to help you buy/sell a house, please see the [find a property lawyer page on the NZLS Property Law section website](http://www.propertylawyers.org.nz/public/find-a-lawyer).*

## Practice areas

####Commercial and contracts law**
An enormous amount of mahi goes into making a small/medium business thrive. I'm really eager to play a small part in supporting your business to punch above its weight. Here are a few examples of ways I can help:
- **Services agreements** I've reviewed or negotiated over 100 services agreements, in areas as broad as software development, IT helpdesking, commercial property management, and maintenance of scientific equipment. Whether you need a contract-on-a-page for a $5,000 engagement or a master services agreement for a multi-faceted project, I've got the experience to help you negotiate quickly without compromising on the detail you'll need later on.
