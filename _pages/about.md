I'm a New Zealand lawyer with six years' experience doing a mix of public, tech, commercial, privacy, and property law. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.

I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a senior lawyer.

I've got really varied interests. I grew up rurally but maintain a city-slicker disposition. I love tech, learned to [copy from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/), and written heaps of [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). I [sued the Wellington City Council](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/125163476/lawyer-appeals-102yearold-law-about-wellingtons-milk-supply) to ~~get the sole rights to sell milk in Wellington~~ make a Very Clever point about the rule of law.  I care a lot about promoting joy and reducing suffering, and I am heavily involved with the [Effective Altruism movement](https://effectivealtruism.nz/). I know very little physics, but desperately want to know if the ['many-worlds' interpretation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/) of quantum mechanics is true.

I am interested in sharing the law with non-legal audiences, and especially in using tech to help with that. I've published a bunch of information, free for anyone to use, to help solve some common 'small fry' legal problems.

I have a Master of Laws and bachelor's degrees in law and economics from Te Herenga Waka \| Victoria University of Wellington. Plus, I'm completing a Master of Environmental Management degree at Te Kunenga ki PÅ«rehuroa \| Massey University. I also have done a bit over half a BA in data science, which I hope to finish as work allows.


## Am I a good choice of lawyer for you?


<details><summary>You need a commercially-minded legal advisor.</summary>
<p>

I'm not a commercial lawyer at a top-tier law firm. I'm not the right choice to close your M&A deal or help you wet lease an A380. This much is obvious.
  
On the other hand, I am a pretty capable contracts lawyer. I regularly draft, negotiate, and review the sorts of commercial agreements that a typical business might want day-to-day legal advice on.
  
* data-sharing agreements;
* non-disclosure agreements;
* IT services contracts (from one-off engagements to multimillion-dollar Master Services Agreements with handfuls of statements of work);
* leases and licences;
* consulting agreements.
  
I've got particular experience with government procurement processes - and can help suppliers  the Government Procurmeent Rules and the Government Model Contract.
  
I'm enthusiastic about better contract drafting; as much as I love a good "whereas" or "hereinbefore", I'm committed to using tools like [Ken Adams' Manual of Style for Contract Drafting](https://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/) to deliver you (and your suppliers and customers) contracts that you can understand and rely on.

<details><summary>You love running your small business, but a legal issue is costing you sleep.</summary>
<p>

I understand how hard you work. My mum has been running small businesses since before I was born, and she never stops going. You don't have that many legal problems - but when you do, the disruption to your business is a real problem. 
  
I'll ask you what kind of advice you need to solve your problem. If you want a traditional in-depth opinion to understand a whole area of legal risk, you've got it. But if you're looking for easy to digest advice that identifies a clear path forward, then it's my job to give you that.
  
I'm a phone call or email away for one-off questions, but can also provide more regular - and affordable - input to help you proactively spot risks before you run into trouble.

<details><summary>You're in a pickle with a government agency or regulator.</summary>
<p>

With six years' experience working with and for regulators, I understand the theory - and practical reality - of regulation.
  
Whether you're trying to get an elusive approval or facing enforcement action, I'll help you see how far up the 'Regulatory Pyramid' you might be and, if at all possible, help you to shift further towards the bottom.

<details><summary>It feels like you'll never end this dispute.</summary>
<p>

Court is no fun at all. And even if the dispute is eventually resolved short of Court, the time and emotional energy that goes into even a simple dispute can leave even the most resilient of us pretty drained.
  
If it comes to it, I can argue your corner in Court. But first, I'll help you identify any options to find a compromise that all sides can agree on, but which still meets your bottom lines.

<details><summary>You think the government is failing to follow the law.</summary>
<p>

The law applies to everybody, and especially to the government. In my six years' working for the New Zealand government, I helped keep decision-makers on the straight and narrow.
  
Putting the [structural problems of the public service](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/01-07-2019/crocodile-in-the-river-how-public-servants-avoid-being-eaten-by-the-oia) aside, almost all of the people I worked with in central government were motivated to do the right thing. I can help you ask the right questions and engage in a way that taps into that motivation, rather than in a way that erodes officials' goodwill.
  
Naturally, there is a non-trivial risk that the soft and constructive approach fails. Having engaged in good faith, you'll be much better placed to challenge the government decision in Court - either with my help, or with an expert barrister taking over.
  
*Note: I sometimes do legal work for public sector organisations. It's more likely than not that I will be able to act for you - but as part of the initial consultation I'll check whether there are any conflicts of interest that may prevent this.*

<details><summary>You've got privacy risks -- or a privacy problem.</summary>
<p>

I know the Privacy Act 2020 (NZ) inside out, and have a pretty good grasp of the EU's GDPR.
  
I've:
  
  * drafted the privacy strategy and Privacy Policy for a significant government agency, so I can help you go to the *n<sup>th</sup>* degree if that's where your risk tolerance lies. 
  * got experience identifying practical solutions that focus on mitigating the big, scary sources of privacy risk - letting you sleep easier without compromising your organisation's ability to get the job done.
  * drafted and reviewed privacy impact assessments;
  * calmly guided the response to privacy breaches; and
  * delivered training to staff in privacy-sensitive roles.
  
For organisations who would benefit from regular privacy support, I offer an affordable 'Virtual Privacy Officer' service.

<details><summary>You're dealing with government in relation to land (e.g. public works, reserves, rating valuation disputes, and Crown land matters).</summary>
<p>

I have a strong knowledge of the legal framework within which government agencies acquire, administer, and dispose of land.
  
I also have a strong understanding of the law relating to local government rating valuations, and can represent clients in the Land Valuation Tribunal. During the March-May 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Aotearoa, I was heavily involved in (and helped draft) a [temporary amendment to the Rating Valuations Act 1998](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0013/latest/LMS343872.html).

<details><summary>You bought a lemon.</summary>
<p>

I'm uniquely enthusiastic about consumer law. If the thing you bought is reasonably expensive and fails to live up to the consumer guarantees, it might be worth engaging a lawyer to help you get the best result possible.
  
If it comes to it, I can help you prepare a high quality application to the Disputes Tribunal or Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal. Lawyers cannot represent clients in the Tribunal, but I can help you improve your chances of a successful outcome.
  
If the thing you bought is not very expensive at all, you might like to:
  * use the templates and guidance on the self-help section of my website;
  * ask about having your consumer issue featured on my podcast - I'll provide assistance free of charge, provided that you'll let me discuss it on the show (without identifying you).

<details><summary>Your landlord seems pathologically unable to comply with tenancy law.</summary>
<p>

I'm very eager to help renters stick up for their rights under tenancy law. I've got good experience in this area, having represented a public sector housing provider in complex Tenancy Tribunal matters, and on appeal in the District Court. I currently provide pro-bono advice to [Renters United!](https://www.rentersunited.org.nz/), a Wellington advocacy group that organises renters and campaigns to make renting better for everyone. ((drafting note: need to approach Renters United before this goes live))
  
I encourage people to look at the templates and guidance on the self-help section of my website in the first instance.
  
However, if your sense is that some support from a lawyer could turn the tide, I will take note of all of the issues you mention - even if your landlord hasn't - and then help you identify your legal rights (and responsibilities, and risks). I can help you draft a 14-day notice to remedy that covers all of the issues, and help you liaise with your landlord.
  
If your case is very complex, we can consider applying for permission for me to represent you in the Tribunal - lawyers cannot appear as a general rule, but I have successfully obtained permission in the past.
