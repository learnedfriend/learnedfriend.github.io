<b>Kia ora!</b> I'm a New Zealand lawyer interested in solving tricky problems. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.

I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a 'lead provider'.

I love the law, and I want to share it with everyone. I've created more than 50 self-help legal resources, which you can find here. I also write regularly about the law here.

To kick things off:
- if your problem is urgent, call me on <a href="tel:+64 27 357 1665">+64 27 357 1665</a>. If I do not pick up, text or email me and I will respond as soon as possible.
- for a no-charge initial consultation, please book directly into my calendar
- for pro-bono or reduced fee assistance, please [fill out this form](form) instead of booking a time or emailing. I will respond to your enquiry within one week.
- otherwise, please email me: tyrone@spilledmilk.nz
