Economists like to think about the wor ld as thou gh it were a collection of functi ons. A person cares about about some thing *Y*, it takes the form *Y* = *x*<sub>1</sub> + *x*<sub>2</sub> + … + *x*<sub>n</sub>, and the person just goes absolutely ham at picking all the right values to maximise *Y*.

One view of my job as a lawyer is that I just help you pick the best value of *x*<sub>legal stuff</sub> in isolation. Sometimes that’s what a client will want - a legal advisor who stays in their lane and confines their advice to black letter law. Generally speaking, though, I reckon a lawyer is better when they help you optimise for *Y*. If you’re game, let’s identify your <sub>wh</sub>*Y* - the thing you really care about - and then let’s work together to optimise for that.

## Ko wai ahau? Who am I?
I'm a New Zealand lawyer with six years' experience doing a mix of public, commercial, privacy, and property law within government. Working directly for the public good was fulfilling, but reasoned that I could have a greater impact as an independent lawyer working to help individual clients.

I've got really varied interests. I grew up rurally but maintain a city-slicker disposition. I've learned to copy from StackOverflow, and written heaps of spaghetti code. I [sued the Wellington City Council](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/125163476/lawyer-appeals-102yearold-law-about-wellingtons-milk-supply) to ~~get the sole rights to sell milk in Wellington~~ make a Very Clever point about the rule of law.

I have a Master of Laws and bachelor's degrees in law and economics from Te Herenga Waka | Victoria University of Wellington. Plus, I'm completing a Master of Environmental Management degree at Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa | Massey University.
