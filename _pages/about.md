I'm a New Zealand lawyer with six years' experience doing a mix of public, commercial, privacy, and property law. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.

I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a senior lawyer.

I've got really varied interests. I grew up rurally but maintain a city-slicker disposition. I love tech, learned to [copy from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/), and written heaps of [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). I [sued the Wellington City Council](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/125163476/lawyer-appeals-102yearold-law-about-wellingtons-milk-supply) to ~~get the sole rights to sell milk in Wellington~~ make a Very Clever point about the rule of law.  I care a lot about promoting joy and reducing suffering, and I am heavily involved with the [Effective Altruism movement](https://effectivealtruism.nz/). I know very little physics, but desperately want to know if the ['many-worlds' interpretation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/) of quantum mechanics is true.

I am interested in sharing the law with non-legal audiences, and especially in using tech to help with that. I've published a bunch of information, free for anyone to use, to help solve some common 'small fry' legal problems.

I have a Master of Laws and bachelor's degrees in law and economics from Te Herenga Waka \| Victoria University of Wellington. Plus, I'm completing a Master of Environmental Management degree at Te Kunenga ki PÅ«rehuroa \| Massey University. I also have done a bit over half a BA in data science, which I hope to finish as work allows.


## Am I a good choice of lawyer for you?

<details><summary>You run a small business.</summary>
<p>

I understand how hard you work. My mum has been running small businesses since before I was born, and she never stops going. You don't have that many legal problems - but when you do, the disruption to your business is a real problem. 
  
I'll ask you what kind of advice you need to solve your problem. If you want a traditional in-depth opinion to understand a whole area of legal risk, you've got it. But if you're looking for easy to digest advice that identifies a clear path forward, then it's my job to give you that.
  
I'm a phone call or email away for one-off questions, but can also provide more regular - and affordable - input to help you proactively spot risks before you run into trouble.
