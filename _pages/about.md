As a lawyer, my job is to give my clients the legal advice and representation they need to make the things they care about happen. Most of my professional experience is in government, where I helped decision makers stay on the straight and narrow. I also provided commercial legal support to large government investments, and handled complex property and information technology matters. Beyond that, I've developed a strong interest in areas of law that are about helping individual people.

Whether the thing you care about is big or small, the fact that you care is what matters to me.

I have experience in:

* commercial negotiations and contract drafting;
* public law;
* privacy law;
* navigating complex public sector processes, including procurement and policy work;
* the Overseas Investment Act 2005;
* Government land matters, including the taking/disposal of land under the Public Works Act 1981;
* residential tenancy law, including the 'healthy homes standards';
* consumer law.
