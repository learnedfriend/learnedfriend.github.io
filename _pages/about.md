I'm a New Zealand lawyer with a knack for solving tricky legal problems. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.




## Ko wai ahau?
I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a senior lawyer.

I've got really varied interests. I grew up rurally but maintain a city-slicker disposition. I love tech, learned to [copy from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/), and written heaps of [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). I [sued the Wellington City Council](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/125163476/lawyer-appeals-102yearold-law-about-wellingtons-milk-supply) to ~~get the sole rights to sell milk in Wellington~~ make a Very Clever point about the rule of law.  I care a lot about promoting joy and reducing suffering, and I am heavily involved with the [Effective Altruism movement](https://effectivealtruism.nz/).

I am interested in sharing the law with non-legal audiences, and especially in using tech to help with that. I'm interested in the intersection of law and emerging technology, including things like automated decision making and 'rules as code'.

I have a Master of Laws and bachelor's degrees in Law and Economics from Te Herenga Waka \| Victoria University of Wellington. I'm currently completing a Master of Environmental Management degree at Te Kunenga ki Pūrehuroa \| Massey University. I have completed just over half an undergraduate degree in Data Science (currently on hold).


## Am I a good choice of lawyer for you?


<details><summary>You need a commercially-minded legal advisor.</summary>
<p>

I'm not a commercial lawyer at a top-tier law firm. I'm not the right choice to close your M&A deal or help you wet lease an A380. This much is obvious.
  
On the other hand, I am a pretty capable contracts lawyer. I regularly draft, negotiate, and review the sorts of commercial agreements that a typical business might want day-to-day legal advice on.
  
* data-sharing agreements;
* non-disclosure agreements;
* IT services contracts (from one-off engagements to multimillion-dollar Master Services Agreements with handfuls of statements of work);
* leases and licences;
* consulting agreements.
  
I've got particular experience with government procurement processes - and can help suppliers  the Government Procurmeent Rules and the Government Model Contract.
  
I'm enthusiastic about better contract drafting; as much as I love a good "whereas" or "hereinbefore", I'm committed to using tools like [Ken Adams' Manual of Style for Contract Drafting](https://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/) to deliver you (and your suppliers and customers) contracts that you can understand and rely on.

<details><summary>You love running your small business, but a legal issue is costing you sleep.</summary>
<p>

I understand how hard you work. My mum has been running small businesses since before I was born, and she never stops going. You don't have that many legal problems - but when you do, the disruption to your business is a real problem. 
  
I'll ask you what kind of advice you need to solve your problem. If you want a traditional in-depth opinion to understand a whole area of legal risk, you've got it. But if you're looking for easy to digest advice that identifies a clear path forward, then it's my job to give you that.
  
I'm a phone call or email away for one-off questions, but can also provide more regular - and affordable - input to help you proactively spot risks before you run into trouble.

<details><summary>You're in a pickle with a government agency or regulator.</summary>
<p>

With six years' experience working with and for regulators, I understand the theory - and practical reality - of regulation.
  
Whether you're trying to get an elusive approval or facing enforcement action, I'll help you see how far up the 'Regulatory Pyramid' you might be and, if at all possible, help you to shift further towards the bottom.

<details><summary>It feels like you'll never end this dispute.</summary>
<p>

Court is no fun at all. And even if the dispute is eventually resolved short of Court, the time and emotional energy that goes into even a simple dispute can leave even the most resilient of us pretty drained.
  
If it comes to it, I can argue your corner in Court. But first, I'll help you identify any options to find a compromise that all sides can agree on, but which still meets your bottom lines.

<details><summary>You think the government is failing to follow the law.</summary>
<p>

The law applies to everybody, and especially to the government. In my six years' working for the New Zealand government, I helped keep decision-makers on the straight and narrow.
  
Putting the [structural problems of the public service](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/01-07-2019/crocodile-in-the-river-how-public-servants-avoid-being-eaten-by-the-oia) aside, almost all of the people I worked with in central government were motivated to do the right thing. I can help you ask the right questions and engage in a way that taps into that motivation, rather than in a way that erodes officials' goodwill.
  
Naturally, there is a non-trivial risk that the soft and constructive approach fails. Having engaged in good faith, you'll be much better placed to challenge the government decision in Court - either with my help, or with an expert barrister taking over.
  
*Note: I sometimes do legal work for public sector organisations. It's more likely than not that I will be able to act for you - but as part of the initial consultation I'll check whether there are any conflicts of interest that may prevent this.*

<details><summary>You've got privacy risks -- or a privacy problem.</summary>
<p>

I know the Privacy Act 2020 (NZ) inside out, and have a pretty good grasp of the EU's GDPR.
  
I've:
  
  * drafted the privacy strategy and Privacy Policy for a significant government agency, so I can help you go to the *n<sup>th</sup>* degree if that's where your risk tolerance lies. 
  * got experience identifying practical solutions that focus on mitigating the big, scary sources of privacy risk - letting you sleep easier without compromising your organisation's ability to get the job done.
  * drafted and reviewed privacy impact assessments;
  * calmly guided the response to privacy breaches; and
  * delivered training to staff in privacy-sensitive roles.
  
For organisations who would benefit from regular privacy support, I offer an affordable 'Virtual Privacy Officer' service.

<details><summary><b>You're dealing with government in relation to land (e.g. public works, reserves, rating valuation disputes, and Crown land matters).</b></summary>
<p>I have a strong knowledge of the legal framework within which government agencies acquire, administer, and dispose of land.</p>
<p>
I also have a strong understanding of the law relating to local government rating valuations, and can represent clients in the Land Valuation Tribunal. During the March-May 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Aotearoa, I was heavily involved in (and helped draft) a 
<a href="https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0013/latest/LMS343872.html">temporary amendment to the Rating Valuations Act 1998.</a>
