<b>Kia ora!</b> I'm a New Zealand lawyer interested in solving tricky problems. Whether you're trying to avoid legal risk or clean up a legal mess, I'm ready to help.

I was previously an in-house laywer with the New Zealand government, but now act for individuals, businesses and community organisations too. I do some pro-bono work, and am approved to take legal aid work with supervision from a 'lead provider'.

I love the law, and I want to share it with everyone. I've created more than 50 self-help legal resources, which you can find here. I also write regularly about the law here.

To kick things off:
- if your problem is urgent, call me on <a href="tel:+64 27 357 1665">+64 27 357 1665</a>. If I do not pick up, text or email me and I will respond as soon as possible.
- for a no-charge initial consultation, please book directly into my calendar
- for pro-bono or reduced fee assistance, please [fill out this form](form) instead of booking a time or emailing. I will respond to your enquiry within one week.
- otherwise, please email me: tyrone@spilledmilk.nz

## Practice areas

### Commercial and contracts law
An enormous amount of mahi goes into making a small/medium business thrive. I'm really eager to play a small part in supporting your business to punch above its weight. Here are a few examples of ways I can help:
- **Services and consultancy agreements.** I've reviewed or negotiated over 100 services agreements, in areas as broad as software development, IT helpdesking, commercial property management, and maintenance of scientific equipment. Whether you need a contract-on-a-page for a $5,000 engagement or a master services agreement for a multi-faceted project, I've got the experience to help you negotiate quickly without compromising on the detail you'll need later on.
- **Confidentiality agreements.** Make sure your confidentiality agreement is more than a tick-box exercise. For simple matters, consider trying my free [confidentiality agreement builder](link).
- **Sponsorship and funding agreements.** If you're handing over a truckload of money on good faith, I can help you document exactly what kind of delivery and reporting requirements will help keep the project on track.
- **Terms of service.** I've drafted end-user terms for websites, web apps, online stores, and competitions and promotions.
- **Data sharing and IP licencing.** I have drafted data sharing agreements that have been executed by central government, local authorities, and large companies.
- **Commercial red teaming.** In cybersecurity, Red Teaming is the practice of testing the security of your systems by engaging an expert to try to hack them. Hire me to do the same for your key commercial contracts, finding drafting errors and loopholes that the original drafter may not have considered.
- **Tender responses.** With an extensive background supporting procurement teams and commercial decision-makers in government, I can help you respond effectively to a potential customer's request for proposals.

### Emerging technology
I am passionate about supporting clever people doing great things in science and technology. Particular career highlights for me so far have been advising on the establishment of the SouthPAN satellite-based augmentation system which will, when completed, improve the accuracy of GPS from ~10m to ~10cm, and the project to modernise Landonline, the New Zealand government's world-class survey and titles system.

I bricked my first computer while still in primary school and was stood down from my intermediate school for... ahem... accessing parts of the school network I shouldn't have. I have taken a handful of computer science, data science, and statistics classes at university and write ~~pretty good~~ spaghetti code in Python, R, and Java. I'm never going to be up to scratch as a developer, but if you want a lawyer who has a pretty good idea what you and your engineers do, I'm not a bad choice.

I'm particularly interested in legal issues arising out of emerging technologies, including developing rules as code, making decisions that affect legal rights using 'black box' predictive models, and the role of law in mitigating the risks arising out of potential future artificial general intelligences.
